                 I believe we are moving on to the programming contest now. 
                >> AYMERIC FROMHERZ: Okay hi everyone to wrap up the farm I will wrap up this first day of tran one. I'm good to tell you about how this year's ICFP programming contest report, and with my infrastructure and we get this whole thing that wouldn't have happened. So to start with, let me give you some context of the ICFP this is a contest that has been sponsored by ICFP since yearly 1998. And it's contest is something that runs over the course of 72 hours. The first one for hours is called a lightning round and its 48 hours were the contest is extended with more problems and more extensions to the initial problem. The knoll limitations whatsoever on team sizes. And this year contest happen over the beginning of July over the course of the weekend. And of the fun things that about this contest is that the organizers change every year. And the because of that a lot of the variety, the problems that are tackled problems are proposed and you can just come and add their own taste and their own interest. So let's talk about the BCS programme. As you might have guessed the icon for the will of a contest. Just problem was about Mesic and especially about optimizing the placement a musician on a stage. So that you would maximize the quality of a sound in the rubric so how does this work? Contestants were given as inputs first with topology of a room, of the stage was considered to be rectangle or thing inside the room. And there was a lot of variety on how the status place. And on top of that, replacement of the information about the attendees. Is what we spread out in the room outside of the stage. And you would be given information about the musicians you have to place on the number and also some extra information such as instruments they are playing a cup more information about the business. Now placing musicians, we have some constraints. Such as the musicians are pretty nice so you should put them on the stage. Musicians it don't like to fall off the stage so you should not place them too close to the edges. And as musicians we like to have some room so you should not place them too close to from organizations. So for instance could be considered a valid placement where you have two positions considered for valid placement. Not to close. And so if you have a musician and attendee at a distance of let's say D. The scoring function from the sound quality for his position to the attendee would be a function of something on the square root of D or the square of D sorry. So a lot of this would involve a lot of floating-. Competitions which have been a lot of wondering this context. One interesting thing is that the other musicians placed on the stage can actually blow the sound. And so here in this case, the musician at the bottom is blocking the line positions and the top of the attendee, because of that the attendee cannot hear the position at the topic and as a simplification we didn't consider the attendees come back sounds. Only musicians could look over. So in addition to ambitious placements, his position was also associated to an intimate. So each attendee has different taste in each instrument. So for instance personally, I really love the piano and the bagpipes but the bagpipes are kind of an acquired taste. And not everyone might be so happy about it. Some people might actually get up and leave the room because they hated. And so it is a positive and negative and so you could place musicians so badly that people would literally hate your concert. So in the end, what is meant is that the musician score was weighted by the instrument taste and then the total score was just the some of the musician identity taste. So this was pretty much the basic problem proposed as a part of the lightning round. And in the first 40 hours we proposed a bunch of extensions to a problem. So we decided to strike a balance between proposing new extensions and avoiding extensions and invalidating of the previous results. So we tried to have all of the extensions that were back across compatible so that people to have as much time to do a full round would still be competitive and happy to have a lightning round. And you could also have pillars outside the stage, which could block the sound compositions the same way that musicians could look at. And the second extension is that the musicians it would actually play better with grouped with same instruments. So if you have a group of fiddlers close together, they are happy to play together and listen to each other, and some quality is going to be better. If you have a poor filter --fiddler alone on its corner, will bite talking about it, the last extension we proposed toward the end of the full round was you could actually control the volume that musicians complete at. So altogether this gives you a lot of flexible in terms of how do you place your position? Do you rather have some musician that are not so good, that broken musicians that are heated by the audience, that are given a lot of flex ability and a lot of complexity to the optimization problem. Now before going into the solutions that are proposed and announcing the results. Let me give you some stats about the context. So overall we proposed a set of 91 problems over the course of the full context. Which range with different characteristics and we are pretty much all automatically generated according to some constraints. This year we had 153 teams that enter the contest. And out of these 158 actually managed to score points. So submitted by solutions at some point. And interestingly we have 15% of first-time participants at that is quite encouraging to see it's not always the same people that do the ICFP contest every year and you have newcomers once in a while. And there was interesting thing for me, we had a lot of solution submitted. Much more than we expected to the point that customer-- in the contest and we had to upgrade several live contest about 50 hours in. And in respect, that sounds obvious, we really should have backed up the database before we upgrade. And if you want to have fun before you go to the reception tonight, and has been a fun two hours into the contest. So if you're interested in this whole thing and the teams actually cemented right up scout wrote about the contest, wrote about the experience, many of your code and write ups are publicly of able in the github. So you are free to search for the ICFP 23 depositories with github and many of them are easy to find. Let's talk about the solutions and technical challenges of the contest. Even though it was a optimization problem. We try to make us current function nonlinear because otherwise the problem would be mushroom in itself. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, the current function in itself with heavily involving floating-. Conditions. And the things like additional to actual flooding points. And the seal and floor functions all over the place. And that has been challenging for some people to get right. And apparently despite saying all you have to follow the standards. That's not very valid answer for some prime linkages. So that's when I was very grateful to have written this whole thing. And on top of that the optimization problem. Competing the current function itself was kind of expensive. So in terms of complexity, if you have it musicians and attendees, we na√Øve complexity of computing the current function was around him to the ^2 times. So as some contestants realise, you can actually do something slightly more effective with right all sweep which gives you more complicity analogy to iterate faster on the solution you're proposing. What did the solutions look like? Unfortunately most of the top scoring teams adopted quite the same solution. Which is an optimization. And the artist might understand that it is a basis using for something funny a local optimum. And avoid getting stuck in the local optimum once in a while you do large transitions that are going to put you further away from this curriculum. And for instance swapping starting positions, swapping musicians or will moving a position to one place or moving musician as far as possible on the stage in one direction, remaining great solution. And the other solutions that have been tried proposed by several people. Despite being very successful early on all submitted and it have time to converge. And very quickly got overtaken and that's why the top scoring teams and abusing similar approaches. Now before getting the actual results I want to talk about the fun part which is seeing the contestants interacting on the discords over. There was a lot of fun quotes fun things exchange on the server, let's start with some quote.
                " Wow, I set bass solo equals true and the number of attendees dropped by 90%."
                " Some... Hate everything but still went to the concert so they can complain."
                 There was one where nobody was happy about any of the instruments. And [Laughter] was always the gadget with what happen. And which was fun when you have a first like top scoring teams that had negative scores and the teams that didn't have a solution yet where the top of the scoreboard. So we fix this live, you know what was a fun time. In addition to a bunch of quotes, there were many people who got very involved in creating visualizations of the problems. And so do some cool stuff like the 3D visualization. I like the last one  that looks like on top of that. So we had some good creative solutions with interesting topologies. I'm not sure how that's optimal but apparently that seems to be one of the problems. And we also had a team that went very deep into creating custom solutions. And as far as I understand that music probably reversed.
                 Okay now to the interesting part, the results of the contest.
                 So the first part is the winner of the lightning round which is a team called " all your sound are belong to us."
                 As the judges prize, we had a team called " coding team" extremely cool bunch of hackers. And the aft sharp + Fortran and it has been really, really fun to read otherwise. 
                And the third-place we have a team called is_tocoder_dead. And second place we had "Unagi" rust is fine programming tool for many applications. In first place, " all your sound are belong to us" C++ is a programming tool of choice for disseminating hackers. So all of the full results are going to be online a bit later, but it should be up by the end of the day. Even better. Okay to conclude, I ICFP problem, test is very tiring but also very, very fun exchange for every involve. And if you like coding, I surely suggest you participate so that we don't have to come onstage every year and claim at international conference on functional programming. But the best language. That would be hopeful. Second, as part of the improvements of this year, we are also working on making easier organising contest to future and especially things out we are now having a rolling share system which makes it much easier to propagate information. In making infrastructure and other things reusable across seeds. And finally what we don't have a date yet, for next year's contest, please stay tuned to both the website and the discord server if you are interested so that you can make sure not to miss it next year. Thank you. 
                >> HOST: Okay I believe we have some time for questions, if there are any questions? Thinking. All right. I do have a question as a formal organizer of the programme contest. The whole transition think I can you elaborate on that how you will make it easier or more convenient for people to take up the mantle of hosting the contest? 
                >> VISHAL: Yes sure, the sense that last year elf was the main share last year. And he did a lot of work and what was needed to be done and very aware. And select the very first value part. And a top of that, we are trained to make sure that the website stays the same and it is easy to find. And a lot of the work on the backend and that is a set thing that you can just reuse in plug-in. 
>> [Speaker away from microphone] 
                >> HOST: It should be okay. 
>> You said one her 43 generated followers, were they like three musicians and four attendees that were like generated, what was the scale? What was I don't know the landers or respirable stages? 
                >> VISHAL: So the stage itself we stayed with rectangle or because it was easier to have one set basically you could represent with three cornice like heights with where it starts on one of the corners. So because we kept the stage principle. For the number of musicians, and attendees a really varied from problems to problems. It was basically between 10 and 100 musicians. Between 503,000 attendees. And the problems themselves different characteristics such that you have mostly people that love instruments that are close to a show at our stuff like that for instance. So a different class of problems and different several problems of each class generated. 
>> Thank you first of all for organising the contest. They must be a incredible thankless job and huge amount of work. So this whole, thank you, tran one contest is a treasure. I just have one class, that next year you not put in the exact same few hour before the Poppel deadline. 
>> [Laughter] 
                >> VISHAL: I would have love this myself, luckily next year's organizers are part of the functional form, but not academics themselves. So they might have a bit more flex ability. So that is something to keep in mind. 
>>  I was wondering if you had staff -- stats on the number of submissions on the different kinds of linkages people used all over? 
                >> VISHAL: I don't have different stats for this what I see is a wide variety of linkages. But still most submissions being in the C + + or rest, we had a lot of press submissions this year. Which is why we love to have more functional performance submissions including Fortran or not. 
                >> HOST: Okay any further questions? No? Okay. Let's and hear them. Thank you to the speaker again. 
>> [Event Concluded] 
                >> HOST: And I believe that concludes the session, thank you.
