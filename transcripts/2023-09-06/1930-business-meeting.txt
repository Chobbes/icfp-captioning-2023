>> Hello everyone! Welcome to this we are going to start getting hours, we are going to have two hours. The first one is influential paper ICP 2013 and this is for papers ICP 2023. Hey will you show the slides? Yes most information paper of ICFP 2013. Presented annually to the authors of a paper presented to the ICFP held ten years prior, the award includes a prize of $1,000 to be split among the authors of the winning paper. The papers are judged by their influence over the past decade. And this year, the 2023 committee, the members are Tony Hosking, the member chair. Greg Morris as the general chair of 2013. Tamil who is the programme PC chair of 2013 and Andrea Bauer general chair of 2022. Aiola and as the PC chair of 2022. And now the war goes to yay! Our own! [Applause] okay yes, yes the title is " handlers in action " and the winners are Ohad, Sam and Nicolas. And let me give you the certificate. The single SIGPLAN most influential paper of ICFP 2013. Congratulations! And same for Sam Lindley. So Sam is going to tell us about his story. 
>> SAM: You can hear me, excellent yes so I'm just going to say a few words. First of all, it is a great honour to well, in the first place be invited to be the PC chair for ICFP and then in the same year get a most influential paper award. But this was ten years ago and the two are not connected. As far as I know. And secondly, yes unfortunately Nicolas, the third author is not hear but he played an enormous role in this work. So I wish to thank him as well.
 I think that one thing I actually wanted to mention was that in 2013, when I presented this paper, it was actually just after my sister had died and it was a pretty difficult time for me. By came to ICFP anyway and I think for me it was the right thing to do. And I was sort of amazed at how supportive and understanding of other people were and just an indication of how nice the ICFP community is. And awesome, difficult and also fond memories of that time. Yes, in some ways I would like to dedicate my part of this award to my sister.
 But yes, moving on to the paper itself. And another thing I would like to say about the way in which the work came about. At the time Ohad was a lowly PhD student. And Nicola and I were postdocs and we shared an office and Ohad and would regularly come in and disturb us. None of us were working in this area really. I think we were writing or thesis at the time? Yeah, but anyway. Just sort of started having a bit of fun. And exploring this new direction that we had not, at least Ohad was the expert and he was giving us all the advice and tips on what this thing was. But we were just kind of hacking and trying out new ideas. And since then and has turned into my main kind of research topic. So it certainly has been very influential on me.
 I got a big grant and I have had well, some amazing PHD students like Daniel who is sitting there in the front row and has done a whole thesis on this topic.
 But I think it was also well I should say also, we should not really claim credit for everything that happened here. In fact in 2013 it was several different things at least three different think important papers there. So Edwin Brady had a paper on programming and reasoning about effects which is also using affect handlers. And Owen Kiseaselli office extensible effects at the Haskell symposium. And also a panel on the Haskell symposium of the future of effects and Haskell. And then since then it's been a huge amount of stuff that has happened. It has been very gratifying to see how a lot of this is taken off.
Um, let's see, should also mention that we were very much inspired and that the title of the paper was handlers in action, we were inspired this monetary-- monitor ads in action by Andre Fullenski. And this semantics that we wrote down was very, very similar to what he had.
 And finally I guess the thing that I would like to just mention is that this is not just a sort of academic exercise. And the subsequent years. It has had quite a bit of a big impact on industry. I'm not sure if it is really our paper necessarily. But conversations that we have had, for instance with Dan Lyon, I think we set him off on a completely different research path with kokca, and then conversations that were indirect that led effect handlers appearing in OCaml five now and influencing the design of systems like reactor JS. Uber had this Pyro language that is building an effect handlers.
 And perhaps one of the more influential things was the fused FX library and Haskell. Which github, I don't think they are still using it but at one point over 50% of all pole requests were  depending on this technology and so that's very nice. Then there is this kind of work is also contending with WasmFX the as Andrea mention in his keynote the other day. And is exciting and I would like to encourage people if you are curious about something, if you are having fun, even if it is not the main line of your research. Up in some time thinking about it and it might turn into something really big. So thank you very much. 
                >>GABRIELE KELLER: So we need to things for you leave that let's see what the committee said about your paper. So this paper to the attention of the ICFP community to the handlers and abstraction for info computation. An expedition and providing the first operational semantics of handlers and effects. And a series of many subsequent works. Pragmatically, it detailed implementation of handlers and Haskell, and outline the ideas behind OCaml, XML and racket implementations as well as providing experimental results comparing handlers with equivalent monadic code. Thanks a lot and we need to take a picture together. Thank you! You can go that way.
                 For now we are going to have three distinguished papers and the authors are supposed to come this way. And stand here and I'm going to give certificates. And we are going to take a picture and you are going to go that way. Okay. Okay. Let's start.
                 The first award goes to... the title is HasChor: Functional choreographic programming for All functional pearl.
                 Okay so when I give you a you are supposed to watch him. Okay. Let me do this. Congratulations. Okay. Shun Kashiwa and it is difficult oh yes. Congratulations and then Lindsey Kuper, take a picture together. Yay! Congratulations! Thank you.
                 And the second award goes to " reflecting on random generation " Harrison, Samantha, Meng, Benjamin.  Meng is not here, okay. So I really enjoyed your presentation. You are good actors. Yes. So the first one, Harrison Goldstein. Yes thank you. And Samantha Frohlich. And Benjamin Pierce. And all together.
                 [Laughter].
                 See, very difficult. Thank you the last one goes to many authors.
                " The verse calculus: A court calculus for functional logic programming" Lennart, Joachim, Koen, Ranjit, Simon, Olin, Guy, Tim, and we have three people here. Sorry [Laughter] you are the last. 
>> [Laughter] 
>> HOST:  Okay Lennart, so congratulations. You come right here. Congratulations! And finally Simon. And altogether. [Laughter] 
>> Can I say something brief? 
>> HOST: Yes sure. 
>> Thank you, I just want to say this a illustrates the power of rejection. That is rejected by the Poppel 2023 but the paper is so much better as a result. So be encouraged of those of you who are about to be rejected by pupul 2024, you should be so happy [Laughter] 
>> HOST: Thank you! The slides. Okay now my job is done. And now the stage goes to Gabriele Keller. Really. Oh! That is news to me [Laughter]. Change up the slides. We need Sam. Yes. 
>> All right to complete this student research competition or the SRT. I hope you all have the opportunity to see the post yesterday and enjoy the presentations that the students gave earlier.
 We had six students participating. We have six prizes, what a coincidence. So yes, without further ado I will just get started with this transition diagram here. Which we will unfold in lockstep. I will start with the third-place for the undergraduate category. And there we have Vishal Caurmalla, and let's give him applause.
 [Applause]
 I think he is not in the room today so I will take it on his behalf. So thank you.
 We moved starkly on in the postgraduate category the third-place we have Kai Pischke. Are you in the room? I thank you should be, yes you, come up here. Come on and join me on the stage here. Maybe we can give him a little round of applause while he's up here. Congratulations.
 In the second place in the undergraduate category. We have Bhakti Shah. Let's give her a round of applause!
 [Applause]
 And moving on to the postgraduate category the second place we have Ernest Ng, please come to the stage. All right now it gets exciting.
 So the first place in the undergraduate, the category we have Cynthia Richey. Please come. And you have to take the long way apparently. And then I guess by process of elimination. All right. So in the first place in the postgraduate category we have Andrew Cheung, please come to the stage. All right, I think we are supposed to take a picture.
 So thank you very much for your contributions, usually this is like metals and papers handed out but the ASM no longer sounds that ahead of time. So that will be mailed to you I guess U.S. post or whatever is used over here. So just want to say look forward to that. And just closing I want to say thank you to the people who are part of that and the committees. Thank you very much for your work. 
                >>GABRIELE KELLER: Okay now three short announcements on behalf of the --okay, can you hear me? So very short announcements on behalf of the Journal of functional Programming she might be aware that since 2020 we have the JFP to ICFP, so for the JFP authors will publish an article and the JFP that's basically original not already an extended version of the conference paper. They bring their work that year and it will happen again in the 2024. So please consider submitting your work to the JFP. Next ICFP. Thanks.
                 
                >> DAAN LEIJEN: Hello everyone! I am Daan Leijen and I will say something about diversity and you may or may not have noticed there is something new this year at ICFP and there is the diversity committee and it was initiated by Simon Marlow, shut out to him if he is still around. And the committee this year is me and Gabriele Keller and Alejandra Russo. And ideas to make a more coordinated, long-term sustained effort for diversity and inclusion at ICFP. And that is the idea. And we have this, I think, all of us have this ideal really to have an environment that is diverse and inclusive and welcoming for everyone and all backgrounds and experience. Where we can all thrive around our shared patience for functional programming. And I think that only we can thrive but the research to can really benefit from more diverse set of viewpoints. And of course, it is also, not so easy, diversity. Olap Kumar put it eloquently that it is not about the people that are in this room, right? And we have to make various efforts to work on that. And I think this year at ICFP with the many events that are aligned to that. Like PLW it is always highly recommended for the PHD starting students to go there. Or the enthusiastic students, we have the two mentoring breakfasts, the LGBTQ + lunch and the underrepresented minorities launch. And we have the women at ICFP dinner. It's tonight at 7:00 PM. If a fantastic place, I encourage you all to go. You don't have to have registered to go. So please consider that. And there is a SIGPLAN a lunch tomorrow afternoon. And many people who have worked really hard to organise this again I would like to thank them all for making this happen.
                 And I want to actually briefly go out and call out SIGPLAN-M the mentoring programme it is a fantastic programme, if you are starting out PC student or you are doing a masters or thing about doing your PHD, you can be mixed up with someone who can help you navigate the pitfalls of a PhD. And they meet some mentors and mentees together and there's a very successful programme. There is now 300 and 200-- 300 mentees and 200 hunters participate in. The actual total is that there is not enough you mentors. If you are in the US and you know the US system walk up please consider joining the programme Richup. Is here and please talk to him otherwise email Nadia Polycarpova for more information. Also if you are a more senior PHD student and you thank you can help, you can also be mentor. Please consider it. And finally there is something new for next year's ICP and we will create a new diversity, equity and inclusion sponsorship category. And there is really an idea by Gabriele Keller and Simon Marlow. And the idea here is that on the one hand we have these companies, big companies like say Microsoft that have special budgets that need to go just to diversity. And the inclusion goals. And they cannot just give money to a conference. So why not help them spend that money and create a specific category were is guaranteed that we look for and it will be spent on the DEI the goals. And on the other side there is actually already many great opportunities for sponsorship for students like PMW the and SIGPLAN the pack and there's also all kinds of resources in place that makes it not possible for everyone to be eligible or to be funded. So I think there's a fantastic win-win situation. We really want to look for this EDI fund it to sponsor those enthusiastic ICFP students and especially from the underrepresented geographical regions. And see if we can help them be able to attend ICFP. Even if you don't have a paper yet. For example and may be is the opportunity to meet a mentor and it can change everything. If you are from there, so I think actually this year we did a kind of trial run of this funding model. And we were very glad to have a sponsor that helped out. And we were able to fund one student from South America region.
                 And he is sitting right there, Augusto, maybe you can show yourself that Israel [Laughter] and we are very happy that it worked out. And we are hoping next year with funding from companies and people that you know, even more people around. And I want to give a huge shout out to Alejandro Russo that worked really hard in the South American region and then Chris McCannski from the PMW and Narengo Young and many others for making this happen on such a short notice. And thank you so much.
                 
                >> SAM LINDLEY: That is a bit unfortunate. You have it? Yes. Okay. So I am back now and in my capacity as the PC chair. I'm just going to say bit about how things went this year with the programme committee experience. So I will start by thanking all of the PC members. And you will see that you should have all received your packs of cards. There is the assignment. Ah, I need to stay close to the podium. So yes, let's think all of the PC members. And if you are in the audience, please stand up. If you are a PC member or an associate chair. I particularly want to think Matthew who is the associate chair. Which is a new thing for ICFP. And I think it is a really great idea. While I am at it, I should actually thank Amal think who is somewhere in the audience I believe that yes who gave me loads of ideas about how to improve the runnings of the PC based on her experience from Pupul Andrews lab last year. And one of them was associate chairs. It made my life so much easier. So basically Matthew helped to manage about half of the papers that were being reviewed.
                 Yes here are the pictures of the PC. We should also think the external reviewers of these people. And a number of we had a number of sub reviewers additional with SIP the and conferences and I continued this is if you are on the PC you must review every paper you are given. But if you have colleagues for students who can help with that process, and that is allowed. And that is what these people did. All right. So yes, may be less think these people as well.
                 Now I am going to say a bit about how many papers we got. And so forth. And give you some numbers. We had 90 submissions which is on the lower end of what I was expecting but is still reasonable. I don't exactly, I don't know the correlation between numbers and locations or things. But we got 90 submissions. 17 of them were PC papers. 73 non-PC papers. PC members were allowed to submit but papers were held to a higher standard. Most of the more regular research papers but we also had some experienced report and functional pearls. And 33 were accepted. With the transition to Packham PL, we always have two rounds of reviewing. So the papers by default are excepted conditionally and then there's another round where we check all the conditions are being met. But the ten papers were unconditionally accepted in the 23 conditional.
                 And this is the breakdown of the PC and also non-PC papers and I will come back to the any minute. And actually if you just look at these numbers, you can see that if you want your paper accepted then you should submit an experienced report. So there is the overall exceptions rate, 37%. PC paper exceptions rate a little bit higher even though they were held to a higher standard and I can assure you that they were held to a higher standard. But the PC papers on average of a higher standard so that is fair enough. And the percentages for the other things.
                 We also had artifacts. An artifact evaluation committee. Which was led by Jannis Limperg and Quentin Stievenart. So can we thank them? And maybe yes why don't people who are on the artifact evaluation committee and in the audience, and the chairs, please stand up.
                 [Laughter].
                 [Applause].
                 Okay. Unfortunate but not so many were able to make it here maybe. Maybe with the new funding I can isms we could get more of those kind of people here.
                 Yes, so there are the three different badges that we have for artifacts. Available says that it isn't some repository, a long-term accessible repository. And then functional and reusable picks all of them got the awards, one of them is functional and the rest were reusable. I always get confused by this because I'm a functional programmer and I always thought functional is better than reusable. But apparently it is the other way around.
                 Yes, so some other things to say about the logistics of ICFP this year. With the largest PC ever. Which meant the maximum reviewing load was six papers. And I had lots of feedback from the PC members saying that they appreciated that. And did make it harder work for me. By having Matthew there. Meant that it was you will. We did not have an in person PC meeting. I think the days of in person PC meetings are probably over. But most of the discussion actually happened -- in as saw having observed the process last year, so that works pre well. But then you have a few papers where the discussion doesn't quite converge or a bit controversial. So just decided we have a zoom meeting for those difficult papers. And we just had seven papers left, so that is quite difficult and short being under two hours meant we could actually have everyone attend from all over the world. I mean okay some people on the West Coast had to get up at six AM and I think then people in the very east it was very late for them but at least it wasn't the middle of the night.
                 I mentioned we have a higher standard and we also had a limited of three papers, three submissions per PC member. And lightweight double-blind. The important thing, the message from Amil Anna try to replicate if you want to get expert reviewers, you need to try really, really hard and so we did. And we aim to get one expert reviewer and one why knowledgeable person as well because it is just expert the maybe you end up with papers that are only accessible to a few people in the community. And we want to encourage papers for people to read as well. Every person was assigned a so called Guardian reviewer who had to write the review and three weeks. And if they saw any problems with getting proper expert review then we could revisit that. I also mentioned the two rounds thing. Already. So I will give you some more demographic information.
                 This is the number of authors by country. You can see that the USA is written at the top there. But we do have, we had one author from, well to from Ethiopia and one from Botswana. So we actually had some submissions from Africa which I think is unusual. And the Botswana, got the paper accepted. But yes, obviously Europe and America kind of dominate here. I have some pie charts by continent.
                 Disappointingly know -- low number of South American contributions. It would be nice if we could encourage more submissions from there in the future. And I guess that from there you see Europeans seem to have had a higher success rate. I don't know why that was.
                 Oh and the big drop there in Asia think that was a couple of papers I had a lot of Chinese authors that were out of school. Kind of skewed those numbers.
                Oh right, so I have distilled some of the numbers of papers based on topic. The topics probably look fairly ad hoc and complicated. This is just what seems to have built up over the years in  the categorization of topics and they mainly used to do the reviewer assignment. Which was actually quite useful for that. Even though that looks like it's sort of a very random election. But I think looking at these is quite interesting on both the submitted and accepted sides. You see that there is a lot of cut will formal semantics is taught there. There is a quite a lot of stuff about programme verification, pipe theory-- type theory, I don't know if this is a good thing but definitely seems to be very much a sort of theory bias in the topics that were most popular. Which is not to say we didn't have plenty of practical papers as well. I will be just for the Douglas. And you didn't see as mention of Effexor. Although there's papers, anguish design affects is on the side. But did not make it over to that side. So again this seems to be this message of if you are doing some theory that may be I don't know if that is embarrassing the PC, that seems more likely to get accepted. And I also look at that data and the number of papers by programming language. And as you can see, Haskell is way ahead of everything else.
                 Those, some of these other ones. Nik and I were looking at the categories in the beginning and saying we seem to have some strange he satirically languages is in here, can we smuggle a couple of our own ones in here? And then there was an Isabel submission and they did not get accepted. But certainly interesting that Haskell is very dominant.
                 And that is sort of about all I have to say. So I would just like to say thank you to everyone again.
                 And Marco should be coming up now. 
                >> MARCO GABOARDI: I said no spoil and you spoil it [Laughter] I am Marco Gaboardi from Boston University but as you saw the next ICFP will not be in Boston also because we had it a few use ago. And we want a new location. So the next location will be Milan, and we didn't have the ICFP four. If you are not familiar Milan is in Italy in the north of Italy close to Switzerland. And like many places in Italy it has a lot of art and history. And is a bit less known than other cities. For its art and history because of the Florence space is more popular but also is on a fair share [Speaker away from microphone] da Vinci code and you wonder where is the painting, it is in Milan in and is well known for its food. Has many restaurants, from affordable to more expensive one. And the reason why I think it is a good location for ICFP is it is connected to the rest of Europe by train or by bus. So people that prefer those kind of transports should be able to access Milan easily but also has a free international Airport. One for Intercontinental flights and the other four European flights including many low-cost air carriers. It has a range of public transportation's. And passes and also is very many share of the bikes of any kind so you will be able to go around Milan as you prefer. It is a big city so you may need to use some transportation.
                 Know the venue is a bit different from this year, it will not be in a hotel. It will be in a conference centre. It is similar to ICFP 2022, so if you were there it was in a conference centre. It will be the same structure. We have a whole floor four our self. So it will be something we can be able to enjoy discussion and the workshop and the meetings we need. And [Speaker away from microphone] in the groups will be-- but I think it will be nice venue. So the venue is in the centre area Milan of and it is served by two subways. So since we will not have been there-- accommodation around the city. We expect some negotiated rate with the external hotel. But the venue is reachable by 2 subway stops and many buses and trams around. There many hotels around. I think that everybody should be able to find a reasonable accommodation. And there is a lot of offering in terms of the affordable accommodation. Or more expensive one. Depending on what you can do. Now a bit more about the organising committee. I will be the general chair. Brigitte Pientka will be the programme chair and Gabriele Keller will be the associate programme chair. And we already have agreed in helping us with scholarships with the programming content and with student research competition and their city. Industrial relationship and so on and we will build a bigger organising committee will get closer to that time.
                 The tentative schedule is similar to this year. The conference will be September 2nd through September 7th. And the call for the paper will be slightly different, it will be the 21st the of February. And we will have a response time and notification in May. This is it, I hope to see you in Milan!
                 
>> Otherwise that is the end of the day's proceedings. I remind you the woman at the ICFP dinner, if you are a woman or identifies a woman please consider going to that. Is at the Andro loft which is across the street if you go up the registration desk we can put you to where it is. Otherwise thank you for coming and we see you again to tomorrow.
